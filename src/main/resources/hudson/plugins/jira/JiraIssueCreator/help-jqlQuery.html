<div>
    When entered a jql search, if any issues match, no new issue will be created.
    <p />
    This can contain <strong>$PARAM</strong> values which will be replaced by the build parameters.

    <p>
        Example:
    <blockquote><pre>project = JENKINS and fixVersion = "$RELEASE_VERSION" and status not in (Resolved, Closed)</pre></blockquote>
    or (e.g., combined with a JIRA Issue Parameter, selecting one issue from a JQL result set):
    <blockquote><pre>issue = $ISSUE_ID</pre></blockquote>
    </p>
