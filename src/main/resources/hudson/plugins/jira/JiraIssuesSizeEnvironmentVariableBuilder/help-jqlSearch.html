<div>
  The number of issues which match this JQL Query will be saved in the environment variable.
  <p />
  This can contain <strong>$PARAM</strong> values which will be replaced by the build parameters.

  <p>
    Example:
    <blockquote><pre>project = JENKINS and fixVersion = "$RELEASE_VERSION" and status not in (Resolved, Closed)</pre></blockquote>
    or (e.g., combined with a JIRA Issue Parameter, selecting one issue from a JQL result set):
    <blockquote><pre>issue = $ISSUE_ID</pre></blockquote>
