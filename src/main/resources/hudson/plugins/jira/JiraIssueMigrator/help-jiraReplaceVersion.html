    <p>If a a value is provided, then only this version will be replaced instead of all versions.
    This is useful if you group issues using fixVersions and want to keep these extra versions during the migration.
    If the value is blank, then all fixVersions will be replaced with the Release Version. <br/>
    If you want to replace versions matching a pattern you can use regular expressions by surrounding the string with slashes, e.g. /.*SNAPSHOT$/
