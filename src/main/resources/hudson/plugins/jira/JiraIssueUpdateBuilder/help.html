<div>
  Performs a Jira workflow action for every issue that matches the JQL query.
  A common use might be to consider a ticket "confirmed" in the last build step
  of a job, or to mark an issue as "merged" if the job is used to merge changes
  from one SCM repository to another.
  <p />
  Optionally, include a comment that will be attached to those tickets that are modified as a result of this build step.
