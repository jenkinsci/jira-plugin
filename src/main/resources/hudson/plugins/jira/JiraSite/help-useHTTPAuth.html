  This option forces Jenkins to connect to Jira using HTTP Basic Authentication, instead of logging in
  over RPC.

  <p>
  It is not clear why someone would prefer this over normal login, and indeed <tt>getIssueWithFixVersion</tt>
  and JQL search is known to break with this setting. Therefore I <b>recommend not enabling this</b> unless
  you have specific reasons to prefer this (and please let us know why you want this so that we can fix
  this documentation).
