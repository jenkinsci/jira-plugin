JENKINS-31164: Configurable issue priorityId, typeId and actionIdOnSuccess

Motivation:

When Jenkins creates a JIRA ticket the priority and type ids are hardcoded and may break ticket creation as noted in JENKINS-31164.

Modifications:

Allow the admin to configure issue priority id and type id from the Jenkins job configuration.
Allow the admin to configure actionId on success which allows the plugin to automatically resolve or close tickets.

Result:

Support for JIRA where the type ids are different and greater flexibility when setting up workflows.
